  text: ' Before I begin discussing my thoughts on this film I would like to establish that I believe this is a well made film with many redeeming qualities, such as the performances and set design. I started The Wailing under the impression that the movie was a crime orientated murder mystery, with no expectation of the supernatural. I was mistaken, and I believe if I did not have incorrect assumptions about the movie I may have been able to enjoy it more. But after I realized my expectations were off it became more and more difficult to be invested in the story. When it comes to horror especially, I think a certain level of ‘faith’ is necessary in order to fully enjoy the movie. The audience must be willing to buy into the world they’re presented in, and because I was already disappointed before the movie could reach the halfway mark, I could not immerse myself within the story. Very little of this lackluster viewing experience is the film’s fault, and I hope this experience has taught me the dangers of preconception when it comes to viewing movies. Hopefully as I watch more films I can learn to let my expectations not affect my opinions and viewing experiences. I believe being open minded to art is not something that comes naturally, as it’s human instinct to recognize and categorize, but I also believe the effort required to be open minded is well worth the benefits of being able to experience and enjoy a greater variety of art. With my current viewing of The Wailing I would not recommend it, but if I were to revisit it I could see myself changing that opinion.',

Formality only acts as a barrier to writing, which is one of the reasons I am writing this a few weeks after having watched the actual film in question. I will catch up on the next few movies and from then on I will attempt to write the entry immediately after watching a movie. Memories of Murder is directed by Bong Joon-ho, famously known for directing Parasite. Bong Joon-ho is incredible at directing intense scenes that have the audience’s complete attention, and Memories of Murder is no stranger to intensity. I found myself completely invested in both the plot and the characters of Park and Seo. The movie is based on real life serial murders that occurred in South Korea. At the time of the movie’s making, the murder had yet to be caught, which is why a large aspect of the film is the critique of South Korea’s law enforcement. I do not have enough knowledge about the topic to have an in depth discussion; however, I believe this movie warrants a rewatch after further research on my part. The real world implications of this film elevate the already intense and thrilling experience of watching this film. I would recommend this film and have plans of rewatching, as I believe there is much more to unpack than what can be observed on a first watch. ',

There are some notable instances of the film which have become cemented in pop culture, and if you didn’t know where they were from it’s fun to recognize them in the movie. The movie does not warrant a great deal of discussion, and I would recommend it as something that does not require your full attention. ',

  text: 'I was very excited to watch this one. I went to the theater with a big group of friends all dressed in pink. I can’t remember the last really good movie I watched in theaters, but this film definitely rekindled my love of movie theaters. Before I discuss the movie itself I want to clear some expectations people have for this movie. This movie is not a complex and nuanced discussion of intersectional feminism and the patriarchal society we live in. But that doesn’t stop it from being a good film, and it still has an important message, even if it is a common one (though not common enough). My favorite parts of the movie were obviously Margot Robbie’s and Ryan Gosling’s performances. They had incredible chemistry on screen, despite their characters not having a typical romantic relationship. Their characters felt separate and unique, and not just extensions of each other, whilst still complimenting one and other. I absolutely adored the set and costume design. Barbie world was a near perfect conversion from childhood imagination to on screen live action. The soundtrack for the movie is amazing too, my favorite track is Angel by PinkPantheress, and I remember sitting straight up during the movie when they played it. I think this movie was important for our current day and age. The virality of this movie has done wonders for theaters and seems like the first sign of movie theaters recovering from the pandemic. I also believe the feminist message of this movie is significant too, because despite being a simple take on the subject. Personally, I am seeing a drastic conservative shift of American culture, therefore now more than ever the basics of progressivism must be reaffirmed. I hope you enjoyed this movie, or plan on seeing it if you haven’t already, and remember you’re kenough.',

This movie was far more playful and humorous than the other Coen brothers’ films I have seen, which I think is for the better. The setting of this movie almost acts as a character as the culture, climate, and landscapes are center stage. This movie highlights an area of the U.S. that is often forgotten by pop culture and the public. The accents, mannerisms, and performances made the film stylistic and somehow realistic at the same time. My favorite shots from the movie are when the snow is used to create an almost canvas like shot, highlighting whatever little color is in frame. Overall I enjoyed the film and would recommend; however, like other Coen brothers’ movies the film leaves little for me to reflect or think about after, at least that has been my personal experience with their work. Despite this I would still recommend a watch as I was still invested during the whole runtime. ',

  text: "I rewatched one of my favorite movies, Brokeback Mountain, while on vacation in Oklahoma at a friend's lakehouse. We watched the movie at night in a crudely constructed blanket fort, the viewing experience felt thematic. I have seen this film before and was glad to rewatch it. Jack and Ennis’ story is one of my favorite romances, and the movie never fails to make me cry. I think the first segment of the film, which actually takes place on Brokeback Mountain, is one of my favorites out of all the movies I’ve seen. The natural beauty and the blossoming romance between the two characters are spectacular. The build up to the beginning of their intimate relationship is far more nuanced and subtle than commonly seen in most romances. On a first watch, a viewer might think that Jack and Ennis’ first sexual encounter was out of the blue and not justified, but with careful viewing of their interactions prior, a viewer can see where and how their romance grows. Each interaction between the two in this segment is intentional and carries a great deal of weight; however, without proper awareness these scenes can be mistaken for mundane banter. I wish more movies would take this approach to romances, where the internal thoughts of the characters are hidden and their actions must be deciphered, rather than having a first person view of one or both of the characters internal monologues. I enjoyed this film as I have enjoyed it before and will most likely again, and I highly recommend you watch it. ",

Every single scene felt like perfectly crafted not a single moment of the film was passed up, every oppurtunity to awe the audience was taken. The hospital scene, the bride's drive through Tokyo, and the entirety of chapter 5 were my favorite parts. When it comes to <q>fun</q> movies this the epitome. I can't wait to watch the sequel and I'll be honest I hope she kills bill. ",
